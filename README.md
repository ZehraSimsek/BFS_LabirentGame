# BFS_LabirentGame
 In this project, I created a maze using Pygame and used the BFS algorithm to reach from the start point to the end point in the shortest way in this maze.
This project was created for the midterm project of my Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems course.

Here is the output of the generated maze.

When the user presses the space bar, the shortest path to the finish will be found.
